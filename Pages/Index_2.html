              Does purposely not wearing warm clothes in cold climate increase your
              tolerance for the cold? While people who live in colder climates have a
              higher tolerance for the cold, everyone should do what they can to keep
              their bodies at a stable tempurature. This will help prevent colds,
              viruses and infections. Further, it will help your body's immune system.

              The most effective way to stay warm is by layering your clothes. To layer
              efficiently, one should start with the lighter layers and finish with the
              heavier, thicker ones. Layering is also efficient becuase if there is a
              change in weather (for example going inside), you can shed the neccessary
              layers to stabilize your body's tempurature.
